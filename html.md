# Learning HTML

Every page is built up of different components.

This is the basis of every good HTML website :P .

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>title of page</title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

Different elements in html:

```html
<h1></h1>
<input />
<h2></h2>
<h3></h3>
<p></p>
<table></table>
```

Html alone looks boring as you can see, white and black, meh.
Css is there to spruce things up, make everything look a little neat and tight HUH.

You can have different types of elements, block and inline.
